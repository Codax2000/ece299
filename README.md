# EE 299
This is the repository for the storage, development, and testing of the code for EE 299 at the UW.
This repository will be a place where the team can develop and eventually publish code such that students should be able to download a branch to their own computer and run it on their own. Alternatively, if they want to work as a team, they can fork a branch to their own github and work on it there.

## Goal
As stated previously, this should be a place to store code. The goal is eventually to have a branch for instructor solutions, a branch for student versions of the code, a branch with the original versions of the code, and a development branch. Ideally, the student branch would be a branch from the instructor branch, with several parts of the code cut out.

## Organization
There are folders in this repository for each lab and the project. Each Arduino file is in a separate folder, so a potential user should be able to download this repository, unzip it, and start running code immediately.
